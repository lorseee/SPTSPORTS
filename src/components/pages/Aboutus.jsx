                Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body; it is the 
                basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. The relationship between the 
                soundness of the body and the activities of the mind is subtle and complex. Much is 
                not yet understood.

                But we do know what the Greeks knew: that intelligence and skill can only function at 
                the peak of their capacity when the body is healthy and strong; that hardy spirits and 
                tough minds usually inhabit sound gods.
